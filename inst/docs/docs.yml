  parameters:

    storage_curve:
      type: "function"
      description: >-
        A function that converts lake levels into lake *volumes*.
        The function should take a single numeric vector as input, and should
        return a numeric vector of the same length as output. The numeric values
        for the default (linear) storage curve are taken from the CHJ report
        [*Modelo de seguimiento de lâ€™Albufera de Valencia con AQUATOOLDMA*](https://www.chj.es/Descargas/ProyectosOPH/Consulta%20publica/PHC-2015-2021/ReferenciasBibliograficas/HumedalesZonasProtegidas/CHJ,2012.Aquatool_Albufera.pdf).

    petp_function:
      type: "function"
      description: >-
        A function that converts values of precipitation and evapotranspiration per
        unit area (assumed to be expressed in millimiters) into volume changes for
        the Albufera lake (in cube meters when the inputs are given in the expected
        units). This function should take two numeric vectors of common length as
        inputs (representing the precipitation and evapotranspiration time series,
        respectively), and should return a numeric vector of the same length. The
        numeric values used in the default (linear) function were computed by the
        package authors, and correspond to the total study area (consisting of the
        lake and irrigation ditches) and the flooded fraction, that are relevant for
        precipitation and evapotranspiration volume changes, respectively.
