  hbl:
    title: "Hydrological Balance of the Albufera lake"
    description: >-
      This layer computes the hydrological balance of the Albufera lake,
      complementing the input information on lake outflows and levels with an
      estimate of the total inflow from irrigation ditches.

    parameters:

      storage_curve:
        type: "function"
        description: >-
          A function that converts lake levels into lake *volumes*.
          The function should take a single numeric vector as input, and should
          return a numeric vector of the same length as output. The numeric
          values for the default (linear) storage curve are taken from the CHJ
          report [*Modelo de seguimiento de lâ€™Albufera de Valencia con AQUATOOLDMA*](https://www.chj.es/Descargas/ProyectosOPH/Consulta%20publica/PHC-2015-2021/ReferenciasBibliograficas/HumedalesZonasProtegidas/CHJ,2012.Aquatool_Albufera.pdf).

      petp_function:
        type: "function"
        description: >-
          A function that converts values of precipitation and
          evapotranspiration per unit area (assumed to be expressed in
          millimiters) into volume changes for the Albufera lake (in cube
          meters when the inputs are given in the expected units). This
          function should take two numeric vectors of common length as inputs
          (representing the precipitation and evapotranspiration time series,
          respectively), and should return a numeric vector of the same length.
          The numeric values used in the default (linear) function were
          computed by the package authors, and correspond to the total study
          area (consisting of the lake and irrigation ditches) and the flooded
          fraction, that are relevant for precipitation and evapotranspiration
          volume changes, respectively.
