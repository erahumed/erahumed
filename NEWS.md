# erahumed (development version)

# erahumed 0.0.2

* Added `clusters` and `cluster_geometries` datasets, containing information at 
the cluster (i.e. aggregate of rice paddies) level.

* Separated computation of ditch inflow percents in a new function, 
`compute_ditch_inflow_pct()`, that leverages on the `clusters` dataset.

* Corrected calculation of total outflow. In this calculation, the Perello daily 
outflow was being set to zero in the case of negative values. This does not make
sense with the current computational approach.

* Updated the `paddy_management` dataset: the irrigation and draining input 
binary vectors used previously were incomplete, with data until the middle of 
August. For this version, the inputs are defined until the 10th of September.
