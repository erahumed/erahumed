\item{dact_m}{A positive number. Active sediment layer depth, expressed in
meters.}

\item{css_ppm}{A positive number. Suspended sediment concentration, expressed
in parts per million.}

\description{

This model component computes the evolution of chemicals applied to rice
paddy clusters, based on the previously computed simulations for
hydrological balance and chemicals application.
The result is a set of time series of chemical masses, one for each
applied chemical and for the three compartments: foliage, water and sediment.

This modeling layer requires the \link{ca} component of the model to be
pre-computed.
