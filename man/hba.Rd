\usage{
hba(model)

\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class \link{erahumed_simulation}, with a pre-computed
\link{inp} layer (\emph{i.e.} such that \code{inp(model)} is not \code{NULL}).}

\item{storage_curve}{a function that takes a numeric vector as input, and
returns a numeric vector of the same length. Function that converts lake
levels into lake \emph{volumes}.}

\item{petp_function}{a function that takes two numeric vectors of common
length as inputs, and returns a numeric vector of the same length. Function
that converts precipitation and evapotranspiration values (assumed to be
expressed in millimiters) into an overall volume change (in  cube meters
when the inputs are given in the expected units).}
}
\value{
Objects of class \link{erahumed_simulation} and \code{erahumed_hba}, for
\code{compute_hba()} and \code{hba()} respectively.

\description{
This model layer completes the partial hydrological balance information
provided as input data, by computing the total inflow to the Albufera lake,
as well as, if relevant, the amount of unaccounted outflow - usually
attributed to \emph{tancats} that suck water from the lake.

It is the second modeling layer, and requires the \link{inp} layer of the
model to be previously defined.

\details{
The numeric inputs for the linear storage curve are taken from the CHJ report
\href{https://www.chj.es/Descargas/ProyectosOPH/Consulta\%20publica/PHC-2015-2021/ReferenciasBibliograficas/HumedalesZonasProtegidas/CHJ,2012.Aquatool_Albufera.pdf}{Modelo de seguimiento de lâ€™Albufera de Valencia con AQUATOOLDMA.}.
The values used as the arguments of \code{petp_function()} were calculated by the
package authors, and correspond to the total study area (\code{surface_P}) and
the flooded surface (\code{surface_ETP}).

The output data.frame of the calculated HBA layer contains a copy of the
input data, as well as the following additional columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{volume} Volume time series, obtained from the storage curve.
\item \code{volume_change} Differenced time series of volume. The \eqn{n}-th is given
by \eqn{\Delta V _n \equiv V_{n+1}-V_n}, where \eqn{V_n} is volume at time
step \eqn{n}.
\item \code{petp_change} Time series. The amount \eqn{\Delta V _n ^\text{P-ETP}} of
volume change due to precipitation and evapotranspiration, obtained from the
P-ETP surface.
\item \code{outflow_total} Time series of total outflows, measured in cube meters per
second. This is the sum
\eqn{\sum _i O_i} of time series passed through the \code{outflows} argument,
plus an extra term \eqn{\delta O} of unaccounted outflow. The correction term
is defined by
\eqn{\delta O = \frac{\Delta V _n - \Delta V _n ^\text{P-ETP}}{24 \times 60 \times 60} -\sum _i O_i}
and is chosen in such a way to ensure that the total inflow is always
non-negative.
\item \code{outflow_extra} Time series. The unaccounted outflow term \eqn{\delta O}
described above.
\item \code{inflow_total} Time serie of total inflows, in cube meters per second.
This is computed as \eqn{I = \sum _{i} O_i + \delta O + \frac{\Delta V _n - \Delta V _n ^\text{P-ETP}}{24 \times 60 \times 60}}.
\item \code{residence_time_days}. Residence time, as modeled by \link{hba_residence_time}.
