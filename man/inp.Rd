\description{
This simulation layer has the only purpose to collect the observational (or,
potentially, synthetic) data used by the algorithms of the ERAHUMED decision
support system.

This is the first layer of the simulation chain and does not have
any upstream dependence.
}
\details{
The \code{outflows_df} input data.frame is meant to capture the observational
hydrological data on the Albufera lake. This consists of a \code{level} column,
that is the daily measured lake water level in meters, plus any number of
columns named as \verb{outflow_*} (\emph{e.g.} \code{outflow_pujol}), that give the daily
measured outflows in cube meters per second.
The \code{weather_df} captures the relevant weather data for simulation:
\itemize{
\item Precipitation and evapotranspiration, relevant for simulation the
hydrological balance, corresponding to the
\code{precipitation_mm} and \code{evapotranspiration_mm} columns, respectively.
\item Temperature, relevant because it affects chemical reaction speeds.
}

Both \code{data.frame}s should have a \code{date} column (of class \link{Date}), and
the corresponding date domain should be an interval (\emph{i.e.} no missing data
between the maximum and minimum of \code{date} is allowed). The subsequent
simulation will only be performed on the largest date interval in which both
hydrological and weather input data is available.

The \code{variety_prop} parameters controls the proportions of rice paddies
allocated to the cultivation of the J. Sendra, Bomba, and Clearfield
varieties, respectively (\code{sum(variety_prop) != 1} is allowed, with the
entries of \code{variety_prop} understood as relative proportions).
