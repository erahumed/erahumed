  model,

}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class \link{erahumed_model}.}

\item{outflows_df}{A \code{data.frame}, whose structure follows the
template of \link{albufera_outflows}; See details.}

\item{petp_df}{A \code{data.frame}, whose structure follows the template of
\link{albufera_petp}; See details.}
}
\value{
Objects of class \link{erahumed_model} and \code{erahumed_inp}, for
\code{compute_inp()} and \code{inp()} respectively.
}
\description{
This model component has the only purpose to collect the observational (or,
potentially, synthetic) data used by the algorithms of the ERAHUMED decision
support system.

This is the first layer of the modeling chain and does not have
any upstream dependence.
}
\details{
The \code{outflows_df} input data.frame is meant to capture the observational
hydrological data on the Albufera lake. This consists of a \code{level} column,
that is the daily measured lake water level in meters, plus any number of
columns named as \verb{outflow_*} (\emph{e.g.} \code{outflow_pujol}), that give the daily
measured outflows in cube meters per second.
The \code{petp_df} captures the relevant weather data for hydrological balance,
that is precipitation and evapotranspiration, corresponding to the \code{rain_mm}
and \code{evapotranspiration_mm} columns, respectively.
Both \code{data.frame}s should have a \code{date} column (of class \link{Date}), and
the corresponding date domain should be an interval (\emph{i.e.} no missing data
between the maximum and minimum of \code{date} is allowed). The subsequent
modeling will only be performed on the largest date interval in which both
hydrological and weather input data is available.
