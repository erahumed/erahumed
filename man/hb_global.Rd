\arguments{
\item{level}{numeric vector. Time series of lake levels, in meters.}

\item{P}{numeric vector. Time series of precipitation values, in millimiters.}

\item{ETP}{numeric vector. Time series of evapotranspiration values, in
millimiters.}

\item{outflows}{a data.frame whose columns are the time series of outflows,
expressed in cube meters per second.}

\item{...}{additional columns to be appended in the returned data-frame. Each
of these additional (named) arguments should be a vector of the same length
implied by the previous arguments.}

\item{storage_curve}{a function that takes a numeric vector as input, and
returns a numeric vector of the same length. Function that converts lake
levels (passed through the \code{level} argument) into lake \emph{volumes}.}

\item{petp_surface}{a function that takes two numeric vectors of common
length as inputs, and returns a numeric vector of the same length. Function
that converts precipitation and evapotranspiration values (passed through
the \code{P} and \code{ETP} arguments) into an overall volume change.}
}
\value{
a \code{data.frame} that contains as columns the input time series, as
well as the following calculated columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{volume} Volume time series, obtained from the storage curve.
\item \code{volume_change} Differenced time series of volume. The \eqn{n}-th is given
by \eqn{\Delta V _n \equiv V_{n+1}-V_n}, where \eqn{V_n} is volume at time
step \eqn{n}.
\item \code{petp_change} Time series. The amount \eqn{\Delta V _n ^\text{P-ETP}} of
volume change due to precipitation and evapotranspiration, obtained from the
P-ETP surface.
\item \code{outflow_total} Time series of total outflows, measured in cube meters per
second. This is the sum
\eqn{\sum _i O_i} of time series passed through the \code{outflows} argument,
plus an extra term \eqn{\delta O} of unaccounted outflow. The correction term
is defined by
\eqn{\delta O = \frac{\Delta V _n - \Delta V _n ^\text{P-ETP}}{24 \times 60 \times 60} -\sum _i O_i}
and is chosen in such a way to ensure that the total inflow is always
non-negative.
\item \code{outflow_extra} Time series. The unaccounted outflow term \eqn{\delta O}
described above.
\item \code{inflow_total} Time serie of total inflows, in cube meters per second.
This is computed as \eqn{I = \sum _{i} O_i + \delta O + \frac{\Delta V _n - \Delta V _n ^\text{P-ETP}}{24 \times 60 \times 60}}.
\item \code{residence_time_days}. Residence time, as modeled by \link{residence_time}.

Computes the global hydrological balance of a water basin from the
measurements of water level, outflows, and precipitation/evapotranspiration.
